Arduino internal temperature sensor related to this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg3qhZfNl0w

This video shows my findings on Arduino internal temperature sensor readings with sources code in the description.
I tempt 2 reading method and tested them on 4 boards and 2 temperatures
With and without calibration values (TS_GAIN, TS_OFFSET), stored in the signature row.

Please read the video to understand the limitation of the funciton implemented in this source code

thanks
